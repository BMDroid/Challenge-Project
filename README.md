Challenge Project of Netvirta

. Found a paper "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features" . And OpenCV has a trainer for Haar-cascade detection. This is quite promising comparing to deep learning methods since it does not need many positive images with the help of opencv_createsamples.
